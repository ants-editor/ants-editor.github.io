Browser Quickstart

Complete the steps described in the rest of this page to create a simple browser application that makes requests to the Drive API.
Prerequisites

To run this quickstart, you need the following prerequisites:

	 Python 2.4 or greater (to provide a web server)
	 A Google account with Google Drive enabled

Step 1: Turn on the Drive API

	 Use this wizard to create or select a project in the Google Developers Console and automatically turn on the API. Click Continue, then Go to credentials.
	 On the Add credentials to your project page, click the Cancel button.
	 At the top of the page, select the OAuth consent screen tab. Select an Email address, enter a Product name if not already set, and click the Save button.
	 Select the Credentials tab, click the Create credentials button and select OAuth client ID.
	 Select the application type Web application.
	 In the Authorized JavaScript origins field, enter the URL http://localhost:8000. You can leave the Authorized redirect URIs field blank.
	 Click the Create button.
	 Take note of the client ID in the resulting dialog. You need it in a later step.
	 Click OK to dismiss the resulting dialog.
	 Click the Create credentials button and select API key.
	 Take note of the API key in the resulting dialog. You will need it in a later step.
	 Click the Close button to create an unrestricted key. In production applications, you can restrict access to the API key to specific websites, IP addresses or mobile apps.

Step 2: Set up the sample

Create a file named index.html and copy in the following code:

	<head>
	 <title>Drive API Quickstart</title>
	 <meta charset="utf-8" />

	 <pre id="content" style="white-space: pre-wrap;"></pre>

	 <script async defer src="https://apis.google.com/js/api.js"
		onload="this.onload=function(){};handleClientLoad()"
		onreadystatechange="if (this.readyState === 'complete') this.onload()">
	 </script>
	</body>
